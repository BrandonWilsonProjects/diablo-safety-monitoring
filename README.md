# diablo-safety-monitoring

Following California lawmakers passing of Senate Bill 846 to extend operations of Diablo Canyon Power Plant in San Luis Obispo County, efforts have arisen to ensure safety of the state’s only nuclear site. Concerns stem from the plant’s susceptibility to earthquake faults, potential for leaks/corrosion and its management of radioactive waste; however, to obviate or replace this plant would risk energy supply depletions consumers can not afford. Monitoring this site will allow for preemptive security efforts to be implemented before a natural disaster occurs. Additional evaluative measures will be taken to vet current weather diversion tactics at this site. 

This repository supports a spatial data science project that uses remote sensing and spatial statistics to monitor environmental and operational conditions around this power plant. A data pipeline and analytics engine will ingest multi-source satellite data (e.g., NDVI, surface temperature, evapotranspiration) and identify high-risk zones/clusters that could indicate infrastructure stress or ecological degradation. A Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) design, using remote sensing pixels, will corroborate the quality of Diablo’s safety infrastructure.
